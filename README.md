# DingWatch-0.2

The DingWatch is a digital watch project I'm working on. My criteria for a successful completed project are long battery life (>1yr, hopefully) off a standard coin cell, some standard life-proof ruggedness, and a solid all-around package I would actually use in day to day life.

Current functionality:
-Tells time in 12 or 24 hour modes
-second increment counter displays what 5 second range the clock is on
-Tells date
-Tells day of the week
-Looks pretty

Planned functionality:
-Menu navigation with encoder and button (planned in menu map, apologies for poor handwriting)
-Alarms (mockup indicators for two alarms on display)
-Stopwatch/timer
-Haptic motor buzz when either alarms or timer go off
-World time, time zone selector (similar to Casio AE-1200)

Once functionality is where I want it, I'd like to work towards designing a schematic, PCB, and casing.


Current components:
-Adafruit Feather M0
-DS3231 RTC
-SHARP LS013B7DH01 TFT LCD
-Rotary encoder w/ switch
-Momentary switch
